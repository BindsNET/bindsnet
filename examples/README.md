## MNIST examples
*/examples/mnist/*  
This directory contains different spiking network structures to train on the MNIST dataset (70.000 handwritten samples). In all these examples, the (28, 28) pixels are frequency-encoded using Poisson distribution into firing rates.

```python eth_mnist.py```: performs a near-replication of Diehl & Cook 2015 (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2015.00099/full).
Two layers with lateral inhibition, unsupervised STDP.  
>*Approx running time of 1 hour on intel x86 i7.*

```batch_eth_mnist.py```: uses the same network as eth_mnist.py, but performs multiple parallel trainings on a GPU, and ensembles the results for faster learning (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.02549.pdf).  
>*Training can be as fast as 1 minute/epoch on GPU (1080ti)*

##### Remarks:
* Rising the --n_neurons parameter yields to higher accuracy.
* Rising â€“-batch_size can drastically reduce learning time, but may lower final accuracy, STDP being averaged through the batch and performed only at the end of each batch.


```reservoir.py```: **Training MNIST dataset using a reservoir computing paradigm.**  
The reservoir is a liquid state machine (LSM) composed of a spiking network (SNN), read out by a simple linear neural model. The SNN structure is a two-layer input-output, with an additional recurrent connection on the output. The LSM output then fed to a perceptron to be classified.  
MNIST data are first Poisson-converted and fed to the input layer of the SNN.
Output from the SNN is used to train the 1-layer linear neural network, which learns the (higher dimensional) representations of the MNIST.

```SOM_LM-SNN.py``` ***Improving upon Diehl & Cook 2015***  
(https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2015.00099/full), with two layers with lateral inhibition, unsupervised STDP, and a Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) property by Teuvo Kohonen (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00317973). This example achieves better accuracy than Diehl & Cook, with additional of clustering the digits by shape similarity.

## BreakOut examples
*/examples/breakout/*  
A reinforcement learning example.

**OpenAI's Gym environments** (https://gym.openai.com/) provide a standard benchmark for reinforcement learning algorithms. The video game used in this example is a simple **breakout** game (https://gym.openai.com/envs/Breakout-v0/), where the spiking network (SNN) tries to maximize its game score.

Here, we connect the _(80x80 gray scale)_ output 'screen pixels' from the emulated video game _(Atari 2600)_ to the SNN. Input of the SNN is a Bernoulli spike encoder, a middle layer of 100 leaky-fire-and-integrate (LIF) neurons. Output is a 4 neurons layer, simulating 4 possible actions on a simulated joystick.

>SNN are believed to perform as good as standard NN, providing enhanced robustness to noise and unseen patterns: (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608019302266?via%3Dihub)

You can experiment with your own hyper-parameters, learning rules or network structures, directly from within this simple Python code.
***


```random_baseline.py``` shows how to setup the Gym Environment, choses a video game and interacts with it.  It provides a baseline score, based on pure random actions.  
**Parameters:** None


```random_network_baseline.py``` same as above, but a complete pipeline (EnvironmentPipeline) is built, connecting the video game Gym Environment to a SNN through an spike encoder (Bernoulli), and connecting the SNN decisions to the videogame inputs (simulated joystick), therefore providing an end-to-end training pipeline. The pipeline is run for '--n' rounds. It shows the changes in the connections between the SNN and the videogame as the game runs.

--dt |1| SNN simulation time increment (ms)


```breakout.py``` same as above, just using Izhikevich neurons and the game is run for 100 episodes (new-game to game-over).
**Parameters**: None

```breakout_stdp.py``` same as above, with 'Reward modulated STDP' learning rule between middle and output layers (https://florian.io/papers/2007_Florian_Modulated_STDP.pdf). The SNN is trained for 100 episodes, then evaluated for another 100 episodes.
**Parameters**: None

## Tensorboard example
*/examples/tensorboard/*  
Google's Tensorboard is a powerful tool to analyze Deep Learning models. It helps visualizing data flows, or any changes happening during a training process.  
First developped for Google's Tensorflow, it is now available as **TensorboardX** (https://tensorboardx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for Py-Torch or other DL fameworks *(under development)*.

```tensorboard.py``` shows how to use the ```TensorboardAnalyzer``` class, graphically monitoring the weights of 2D convolutional SNN during its training process.

>The example also shows how to do the same using the MatplotlibAnalyzer class, outputting the graphs rendered by Matplotlib.
